[Top](#enspiral-labs-faq)

###What are the requirements of being a partner?

A partner is all in on labs and runs all their contracting and startups through the co-operative.

A partner is someone who has spent time to get to know the other lab rats, invested their time and energy and demonstrated good judgement and skills.

Partners are expected to attend weekly lab meetings and monthly working bees.

###Do partners profit from labs?
Yes. We are committed to using our surplus to fund the commons but the intent is that partners share in some of the surplus generated by the co-operative.


##CX (Customer Experience Steward)
###How are Cxers appointed?
A standard consent decision of partners.

##Contributors

##Contractors
#Products
[Top](#enspiral-labs-faq)
Principle is that everything Labs sells is a product

###How does a product start?
Products start as prototypes, these are projects, programmes or software that are created and delivered in controlled environments. 
A product agreement is needed in order to sell that product. 
A consent decision from partners is required to start a product 

###Who controls a product?
The product stewards are responsible for on-going decisions for the product.

###Who can sell or deliver a product?
The product stewards approve the CX people who are approved to sell a product.

###What is a product agreement?
A document listing who the product stewards are, the basic overview of the product, who any investors are.
Product agreements are started by partner consent, changed by advice process by the product steward. They also define how revenue from products are shared. 
Product agreements are listed in our handbook.

This is the responsibility of the product stewards to manage.

###How do Pods work?
Pods:
Have a partner
Have intentional continuity (live beyond just one project) 
Possibly incubating their own projects
Pod members are financially interdependent
Pod’s are financially independent - have their own balance and my.enspiral accounts
Support each other when they need holiday, provide a cash offer, provide support around work and upskilling
Only a pod can offer an employment contract or sponsor visas
Pods have their own rules and processes

###How does someone join a pod?
They ask a pod and a pod says yes. 

###How do Pods work with each other?
To be uncovered

###What about people who aren’t in a pod?
Pods are the model we encourage for interdependency and security. 
Only CX members can sponsor a project outside of a Pod, and invite in contractors or contributors to work in Labs as part of a delivery team.
When a partner sponsors a contributor or contactor they become their stewards
The partners steward each other

###How do pods form?

We are currently a team in Enspiral Services and will be starting a LLC with a co-operative constitution registered in New Zealand. Intention is to start the company in September 2016 once we have determined our founding partners.
Longer term we intend to be a multi-entity structure with companies in multiple jurisdictions. We aim to have a European entity soon and each of these will be owned by all of the founding partners
In the future, we will look to issue different forms of shares for different products to enable investment. There’s also the possibility of shareholding in different legal entities.

Some of our products will become stand alone legal entities separate from Labs.
